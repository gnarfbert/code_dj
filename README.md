# Code-DJ
Code DJ is a program that recommends five new songs based on one inputted song.

## Installation 
Create a Python virtual environment, make sure to check the box next to requirement.txt.

## Process
- I used the song's energy, tempo, genre, and loudness range to filter songs in the dataset.
- With these similar songs, I used web-scraping techniques to record the lyrics of five randomly selected songs.
- Lastly, I used Natural Language Processing with the spaCy library to compare the similarity score between the songs.
